    <p style="color:rgb(18, 44, 154);"><strong>A more interesting sequel to "Who Is Esha?" </strong> 
    </p>
    Mahati. Mmmm. Delicious. She has a llama named Dave and she used to have a llama named Katrina. Sadly, Katrina drank was fed a bottle of poison by Mahati, who had no idea it was poison! Sounds like The Emperor's New Groove! 
    <p>
    
    Anywhoseeee, Mahati is also an indian mom. She LOVES Kathy, Jimothy and Timothy's mom. Ooh la la! She is an indian daughter, too. She is soo good at applying makeup. YAAASSSS!!

    Her favorite pet would be a cat. However, the "overlord has a soft spot for penguins" as she says so herself. She knows Esha, who I also made an article on.

    MUTTY MUTTY is her nickname. MUTTY MUTTY is a very nice and very derpy person TBH. Well, that's it about MUTTY MUTTY. I hope you enjoyed!
